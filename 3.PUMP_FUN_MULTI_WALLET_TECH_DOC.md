# Pump.fun Multi-Wallet Buying Tool - Technical Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the technical architecture and methodology for creating a tool that executes 100 pump.fun coin purchases simultaneously across 100 different wallets, ensuring all transactions are included in the same block without using lookup tables (LUT) or transaction bundles.

## Core Requirements Analysis

### Primary Constraints
1. **100 wallets** - Each wallet must execute one purchase transaction
2. **Same block execution** - All 100 transactions must be included in the same block
3. **No Lookup Tables (LUT)** - Transactions must not use LUT optimization
4. **No Bundling** - Cannot use transaction bundling mechanisms
5. **Pump.fun compatibility** - Must work with pump.fun's smart contract interface

### Technical Challenges
- **Block timing synchronization** - Ensuring all transactions reach the mempool simultaneously
- **Gas optimization** - Managing gas prices to ensure inclusion without LUT
- **Network congestion handling** - Dealing with Solana's dynamic fee market
- **Wallet management** - Coordinating 100 wallets efficiently
- **Transaction ordering** - Ensuring proper nonce/sequence management

```

## Detailed Implementation Methodology

### Phase 1: Pre-Execution Setup

#### Wallet Initialization Process
1. **Wallet Generation**
   - Create 100 unique Solana keypairs
   - Generate deterministic addresses for reproducibility
   - Store wallet data in encrypted format

2. **Balance Verification**

   - Calculate: Gas cost + Purchase amount + Buffer
   - Top up wallets if necessary

3. **Network Connection**
   - Establish RPC connections to multiple Solana endpoints
   - Implement failover mechanisms
   - Test connectivity and response times

#### Transaction Preparation
1. **Pump.fun Contract Analysis**
   - Identify the exact contract address

2. **Transaction Construction**
   - Create identical transaction structure for all wallets
   - Set consistent gas parameters
   - Avoid LUT optimization flags
   - Generate transaction signatures

### Phase 2: Synchronization Strategy

#### Timing Mechanism
```
Core Logic:
1. Monitor current block height

   - Broadcast all 100 transactions simultaneously
   - Monitor initial propagation

3. **Real-time Monitoring**
   - Track transaction status
   - Monitor block inclusion
   - Handle any failures or delays

### Phase 4: Verification and Reporting

#### Block Verification
```
Function: verifyBlockInclusion()
- Retrieve block data for target block
- Extract all transaction hashes
- Compare with our 100 transaction hashes
- Generate verification report
```

#### Success Metrics
- All 100 transactions included in same block
- No failed transactions
- Optimal gas usage
- Complete transaction hash list
